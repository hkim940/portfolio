          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <blockquote>
            FutureScape™ is a modeling and simulation platform that
            creates digital replicas of large systems, such as entire cities or
            large industrial infrastructure. Inside the digital twin,
            FutureScape puts users in control to run scenarios and experiment
            with solutions.

            FutureScape is a modeling and simulation platform that allow users
            to run simulations to test their
            <strong>what if?</strong> solutions. Thus allowing users to
            understand and analyze the impact of future event that may take
            place.
          </p>
          <p>
            As one of the developer within the Simulation Dashboard Application
            Team, my role on the team was to create an initial version of the
            simulation dashboard application where users can launch, monitor and
            analyze the simulation.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to ensure that the application is capturing the needs of
            the user, the dashboard team attended weekly sessions with one of
            our potential clients where we showcased the updated features and
            collect user feedback. Initial version has been released to client
            few months ago for testing. Currently, the dashboard team is working
            with the automation team to create a new version of the dashboard
            that automates the setup and launch process of the dashboard for
            potential clients.

          <h3>Features</h3>
          <span class="feature">
            <h4>Simulation Configuration</h4>
            <p>
              The application allows users to upload their own files and change
              different metrics of the simulation - providing users with maximum
              flexibility to ensure that the simulation closely captures their
              desired scenario.
            </p>
          </span>
          <span class="feature">
            <h4>Real-time Status</h4>
            <p>
              The application consists a real-time status feature - where users
              can monitor the status of the launched simulation. If the
              simulation was not able to complete its run, the application
              provides a brief explanation of the occurred error.
            </p>
          </span>
          <span class="feature">
            <h4>Analytics</h4>
            <p>
              Once the simulation has finished running, the application allows
              users to analyze the result of either single or two simulation
              runs by generating sets of KPIs and graphs.

          <p>
            Several different technologies, such as Angular JS, Node.js, AWS, D3
            and more, were used to generate the dashboard.
