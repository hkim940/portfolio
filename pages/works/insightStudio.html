            and clients to understand client's challenges through user-centered
            design and produce solutions that will solve their toughest problem.

          <h3>Achievement</h3>
          <p>On March 2019, I attended a Hackathon Event hosted by Deloitte and one of our client in banking industry. 
            Goal of the Hackathon was to create a clever and innovative solution that will solve a problem that currently exists in the banking industry
            within 48 hours. </p>
          <blockquote>How can we allow older generation of users who may not be so familar with digital experience to convert from analog solution?</blockquote>
          <p>Our team presented a 10 minute presentation where we demonstrated an interactive prototype and MVP of our solution along with a proposal.
          </p>
          <p>Our solution was not only to create an application that will increase the familiarity to the older generation, allowing them to slowly convert to digital method of banking, but also 
            provide a plan on how we will introduce this application to the older generation and how we will help them get accostomed to this new way of banking.
          </p>
          <strong>Please note that due to confidentiality reason, detail of the solution cannot be shared.</strong>
